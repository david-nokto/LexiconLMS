# Group 1 motto: "Function before form!"


When merging any branches into master, we tell each other in the chat.

Commit often, but nothing that is broken.

If conflicts are across branches/tasks then we talk and share screens.

Comment anything that is not obvious, choose good variable names.

Review as often as possible. If you get stuck for around an hour, ask for help.

"Standup"-meetings at: 09:05, 13:05 and 16:45.
